' Here's an example of the macro in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) that toggles between the light and dark modes:

Sub ToggleTheme()
    Dim currentTheme As String

    currentTheme = Application.Themes(1).Name

    If currentTheme = "Colorful" Then
        Application.Themes.Apply "Basic Gray"
    Else
        Application.Themes.Apply "Colorful"
    End If
End Sub
