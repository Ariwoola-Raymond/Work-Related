#### There are several ways to show the adoption rate of a new knowledge management system, but the best approach will depend on the specific goals and requirements of your organization. Here are a few common methods:

* **User logins**: One of the most straightforward ways to measure adoption is to track the number of user logins to the system. This can give you a sense of how many people are actively using the system and can help identify any issues that may be preventing others from logging in.

* **Number of contributions**: Another way to measure adoption is to track the number of contributions made to the system. This can include things like the number of documents added, the number of comments made, or the number of questions asked.

* **Time spent on the system**: Tracking the amount of time users spend on the system can give you a sense of how engaged they are with the system and how much value they are getting from it.

* **Feedback surveys**: Conducting regular feedback surveys can help you understand user satisfaction and identify areas where the system may be falling short. Surveys can be sent to all users or targeted to specific groups, such as new users or power users.

* **Training completion rate**: Tracking the completion rate of the training sessions on the new system can also give an insight on the adoption rate.

* **Integration with other systems**: Another way to measure adoption is to track the integration of the new system with other systems within the organization. This can help you understand how well the system is being integrated into existing workflows and processes.

###### It's important to note that a combination of these methods can give a more comprehensive view of the adoption rate of the system.

#### There are several ways to show the adoption rate of a new knowledge management system among employees, but the best way will depend on the specific needs and goals of your organization. Here are a few common options:

* **User metrics**: One of the most straightforward ways to track adoption is to track usage metrics such as the number of active users, number of logins, and number of content contributions. These metrics can provide insight into the level of engagement with the system and can be used to identify areas for improvement.

* **Surveys**: Surveys can be used to gather feedback from employees on their experience with the system, including their level of satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived benefits. Surveys can also be used to identify any issues or obstacles that may be hindering adoption.

* **Focus groups**: Focus groups can be used to gather qualitative data on the adoption of the system. These groups can be used to explore the reasons why some employees may not be using the system, and can provide insight into what can be done to improve adoption.

* **Case studies**: Case studies can be used to highlight the benefits and successes of employees who have adopted the system. These examples can be used to promote the system and inspire other employees to adopt it as well.

* **Training and support**: The provision of training and support can be an important factor in promoting adoption of a new knowledge management system. It can be useful to track the number of employees who have attended training or sought support, as well as the level of satisfaction with this training and support.

###### It's important to keep in mind that adoption rate is a gradual process and it's not just about the number of users, but also about how well the system is meeting the needs of the organization, how well it is integrated into the daily work and how it is helping the employees to improve their performance.
