That's a great opportunity for you to engage with your CEO on a personal level. However, remember to keep it respectful and balanced between professional and personal interests. Here are some pointers:

1. **Company-related Topics:** Express your interest in the overall vision of the company and the current strategic initiatives. Show curiosity about the history of the company and its growth journey. You can also discuss recent developments, success stories, or challenges the company is currently facing.

2. **Leadership:** Ask about their leadership journey and style. People usually like to share their experiences and lessons learned. This also helps you to understand what qualities they value.

3. **Industry Trends:** CEOs are often thinking about the big picture. Show that you're also informed and interested by discussing broader trends in your industry.

4. **Personal Growth & Career Development:** You can subtly discuss your career aspirations without appearing overly ambitious. Asking for their advice on your career development can flatter them and also provide you with valuable guidance.

5. **Books or Articles:** If you've read a book or an article recently that you think they might find interesting, bring it up. This shows that you are proactive about learning and development.

6. **Hobbies or Interests:** If you know the CEO has a certain hobby or interest, such as golf, travel, or reading, you can bring up these topics. However, make sure you are genuinely interested or knowledgeable about these topics.

7. **Current Events:** Talking about non-controversial current events or news can be a safe bet, as long as you are sure they are well-informed and interested in the topic.

8. **Shared Experiences:** Discuss any shared experiences or common connections. These could be things like attending the same university, growing up in the same city, or even having similar travel experiences.

Remember to be yourself and to listen attentively. CEOs often have a wealth of experience and knowledge to share, and your coffee chat could be a valuable learning opportunity. Show genuine interest in their thoughts and ideas. Avoid dominating the conversation and allow it to flow naturally.

And lastly, remember to follow up after your meeting with a thank-you note or email. Express appreciation for their time and share how the conversation was beneficial for you.
