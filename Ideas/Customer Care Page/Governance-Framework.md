# Governance Framework

Content governance resolves potential issues in your content production process before they even become a problem. It might help clear up:

The best approval process for new content

What content should use a template

Editorial guidelines for the content team 

How and when to review old content for relevance

The correct metrics and KPIs do you use to measure success


-- The main advantages of setting up a content governance framework are
* Consistency of content *
* Better planning *
* Enhanced collaboration *
* Higher quality *



## Idea 1
Building a perfect governance framework for content management involves several steps, including:

Define clear policies and procedures for creating, editing, and publishing content. Establish a content workflow.

Establish roles and responsibilities for those involved in the content management process, including content creators, editors, and publishers.

Implement a system for reviewing and approving content before it is published.

Establish a process for handling and resolving disputes or errors in content.

Regularly review and update the governance framework to ensure it remains effective and efficient.

Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as data privacy and intellectual property laws.

Use technology to automate and streamline the content management process where possible.

Encourage feedback and suggestions for improvement from all stakeholders.

Regularly audit and monitor the content management process to identify and address any issues or areas for improvement.

Communicate the governance framework to all stakeholders, including content creators, editors, and publishers, and provide training as needed.



## Idea 2
Building a perfect governance framework for content management requires a combination of several factors. Here are some key considerations to keep in mind:

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities: Identify who is responsible for creating, editing, approving, and publishing content.

Workflow and approval process: Establish a clear process for how content is created, reviewed, and approved before it is published.

Standards and guidelines: Develop a set of standards and guidelines for content creation, such as tone, style, and formatting, to ensure consistency across all content.

Metrics and reporting: Develop metrics to measure the performance of the content and the effectiveness of the governance framework, and establish a reporting mechanism to track progress.

Continuous improvement: Regularly review and update the governance framework to ensure it remains effective and relevant.

Communication and training: Ensure that all stakeholders understand the governance framework and their roles and responsibilities within it. Provide training to help them create and manage content effectively.

Technology: Use technology such as content management systems, digital asset management, and automation to support the governance framework.

It's important to keep in mind that a governance framework is not a one-time project but an ongoing effort. It should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains effective and relevant.



### Establish a content workflow

For example, the typical content workflow includes such steps:

Brainstorm ideas and outline them into tasks.

Assign ideas to writers or other content creators. 

Create a piece of content. 

Review the material.

Edit content if needed.

Optional: assign the task to another person (for example, writer creates a ticket for design, photographer sends pictures for retouching, author hands the scenario over to a video creator, etc.)

Review again.

Approve.

Post.

Distribute.

Analyze.

Edit over time.
