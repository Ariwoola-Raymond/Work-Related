Want to create a simple bot on MS Teams bot that auto responds to messages

Creating a simple auto-response bot on Microsoft Teams can be done using the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK and registering the bot with the Microsoft Bot Connector service. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Prerequisites:

Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
Install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor.
Set up a Microsoft Azure account (https://azure.microsoft.com/)
Create a new bot project:

Open a terminal or command prompt, and run:

`java`
npx generator-botbuilder@latest
Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new bot project.

Open the generated project folder in Visual Studio Code or another code editor.

Modify the bot code:

In the project folder, open the file index.js or index.ts, depending on your project's language.

Locate the onMessage function. This is where you'll implement your auto-response logic.

Update the onMessage function as follows:

`javascript`
this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
  const text = context.activity.text.toLowerCase();
  const replyText = `You said: '${text}'. This is an auto-response.`;
  await context.sendActivity(MessageFactory.text(replyText, replyText));
  // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
  await next();
});


Register the bot with Microsoft Bot Connector:

Go to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in.
Click "Create a resource" and search for "Bot Channels Registration".
Fill in the required information, including a unique bot name and Microsoft App ID.
Click "Create" to register your bot.
After the deployment is complete, go to the "Resource" page and click "Channels" under "Bot Management".
Add the Microsoft Teams channel by clicking on the Microsoft Teams icon and following the instructions.
Run the bot locally:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run:

`sql`
npm install
npm start
Test the bot on Microsoft Teams:

Download and install the "App Studio" app in Microsoft Teams.
Create a new app package and fill in the required information.
In the "Bots" section, add your bot by providing the Microsoft App ID and a suitable name.
Install the app package in your Microsoft Teams client.
You should now be able to chat with your bot in Microsoft Teams, and it will auto-respond to your messages.
Note: This is a basic example, and there are many ways to enhance the bot's functionality. For more advanced features, consult the Microsoft Bot Framework documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics?view=azure-bot-service-4.0).
