To conduct a Current state assessment for a bank's call center team currently using a knowledge management system, you can follow these steps:

Identify the scope of the assessment: Determine the scope of the assessment by identifying the specific areas of the knowledge management system and articles that will be assessed. Examples of areas to consider include the accuracy, relevance, completeness, and clarity of the articles.

Define the assessment criteria: Develop a list of assessment criteria that will be used to evaluate the articles and the knowledge management system. This could include factors such as the article's readability, consistency with bank policies, and adherence to regulatory guidelines.

Conduct a content audit: Perform an audit of the articles uploaded to the knowledge management system to identify inconsistencies and areas where best practices are not being followed. This could involve reviewing articles for accuracy, completeness, and relevance.

Conduct a system assessment: Evaluate the knowledge management system to identify any technical issues or limitations that may be impacting the quality of the articles.

Collect feedback from stakeholders: Gather feedback from the call center team and other stakeholders on their experience using the knowledge management system. This feedback can provide insight into areas where the system is not meeting the needs of users or where training may be needed.

Analyze findings: Analyze the findings from the content audit, system assessment, and stakeholder feedback to identify patterns and themes.

Develop recommendations: Based on the analysis, develop a set of recommendations for improving the quality of the articles and the knowledge management system. These recommendations should be practical, actionable, and aligned with the overall goals of the bank.

Present findings and recommendations: Finally, present the findings and recommendations to key stakeholders, including the call center team, to gain buy-in and support for implementing the proposed best practices.
