### As a project, how do i go about revamping Retail Branch Experience ?

* Conduct research to understand the current customer experience at the retail branch. This can include surveys, focus groups, and observations.

* Identify pain points and areas for improvement in the current experience.

* Develop a plan for addressing these issues, including specific goals and objectives.

* Implement changes, such as new technology, training for staff, or changes to the layout of the branch.

* Monitor and measure the effectiveness of the changes, and make adjustments as needed.

* Communicate the changes to customers and staff, and train staff on how to provide the new experience.

* Continuously evaluate and improve the experience to ensure customer satisfaction and retention.

It is also important to gather feedback and regularly assess the experience through surveys, interviews and other forms of customer feedback. This will help you keep track of the progress of the revamp project and make necessary changes as required.

### An ideal customer journey for a product/transaction request at a retail branch would involve the following steps:

* **_Welcome_**: The customer is greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff member, who welcomes them to the branch and asks if they need any assistance.

* **_Identification_**: The customer is asked to provide identification to verify their identity and confirm their account information.

* **_Product Information_**: The customer is provided with detailed information about the product they are interested in, including its features, benefits, and pricing. The staff member also answers any questions the customer may have.

* **_Product Demonstration_**: The customer is given the opportunity to see and test the product in person, if possible.

* **_Transaction_**: The customer completes the transaction, whether it's purchasing a product or requesting a service. They are walked through the process step-by-step and any forms are explained to them.

* **_Follow-up_**: The customer is given the option to sign up for follow-up communications, such as emails or SMS messages, with information about related products or services.

* **_Feedback_**: The customer is asked to provide feedback on their experience, through a survey or through a direct conversation with a staff member.

* **_Thank you_**: The customer is thanked for their business and provided with any necessary information about next steps, such as delivery or installation.

Overall, the customer journey should be seamless, efficient, and personalized. Staff should be well-trained and equipped to handle the customer's request, with a focus on providing excellent customer service and making the transaction as smooth and easy as possible.
