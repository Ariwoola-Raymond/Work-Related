## You can use SharePoint's file library feature to version control a Word document by following these steps:

> Create a new library in SharePoint to store your Word documents. You can do this by going to the SharePoint site, clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner, and selecting **"Add an app."** From there, select **"Document Library."**

Once the library is created, upload your Word document to it.

Go to the library settings by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner and selecting **"Library settings."**

In the settings, enable versioning by selecting **"Versioning settings"** and choosing **"Create major versions."** This will allow SharePoint to keep track of all changes made to the document.

After enabling versioning, you can edit the document and save your changes. SharePoint will keep track of the new version and will allow you to view and restore previous versions if necessary.

You can view the version history by opening the document, going to the **"File"** menu, and selecting **"Version history."** This will allow you to view all previous versions of the document, compare versions, and restore an earlier version if needed.

You can also setup check-in and check-out feature, so that multiple users can't edit the document at the same time, preventing conflicts and loss of data.

Please note that, this feature needs to be enabled by SharePoint administrator if it's not already enabled.

### How many versions can it store?

> The number of versions that can be stored in SharePoint's file library depends on the versioning settings that have been configured by the SharePoint administrator.

By default, ***SharePoint allows for a maximum of 500 versions per file***, however, the administrator can increase or decrease the number of versions that can be stored. If you want to store more versions than the default limit, you should contact your SharePoint administrator and ask them to increase the limit.

When a file reaches the maximum number of versions, SharePoint will automatically delete the oldest versions to make room for new versions. However, the administrator can also set the retention policy to retain specific versions.

It's also worth noting that, if the versioning is not enabled, the library will only store the last version of the document.

Please note that, the number of versions that can be stored may also be limited by the amount of storage space available on the SharePoint server.
