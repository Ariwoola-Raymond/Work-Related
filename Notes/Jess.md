Dear Susanna,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request some information related to Service Quality. We are currently conducting a CSA on the migration and transformation of CCO's contents, and we require the following information:

Average wrong SQ score for CCO Inbound Team and Liv. Team for the past 7 months broken down based on agent tenure.
Fatal reasons for the last 7 months: repeated calls, chats, and emails (repeated contact by the customer for the same issue).
If the above analyses are not readily available, we would appreciate it if you could share the raw data with us, and we will extract the necessary information from there.

We would appreciate it if you could provide us with the information as soon as possible. The data will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and will only be used for the purpose of the current state assessment.

Thank you for your cooperation. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
