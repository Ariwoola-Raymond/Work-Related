I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss the importance of migrating from the legacy tool to the new version that was developed to address the existing throttling issues.

As you may recall, we identified numerous issues with the legacy system, which led to the development of a more efficient and reliable tool. We successfully conducted a pilot with two agents, and the plan was to migrate the remaining agents to the new system. Please note that considerable time and effort were invested in creating this tool outside of my regular responsibilities.

I understand that providing KM access to the users mentioned could offer a temporary solution. However, this will not change the fact that the legacy tool is nearing the end of its life cycle and could become inoperable or entirely unusable without warning. To prevent any disruptions and maintain optimal productivity, I highly recommend migrating your agents to the new tool as soon as possible. The new tool has been designed with no dependencies on KM access, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.

It is important to remember that the initial intention behind creating this tool was to serve as a temporary solution until Freshworks could provide the necessary built-in system functionalities. Relying on the SharePoint-based tool is not sustainable in the long run. Additionally, due to my recent change in job role, I may not be available to provide ongoing maintenance and support for the legacy tool.

In light of these factors, I strongly urge you to consider the immediate migration of your agents to the new tool. This transition will ensure improved efficiency, sustainability, and overall performance for your team.
