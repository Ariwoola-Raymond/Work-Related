Subject: Inclusion of Knowledge Office Team Mailbox in Mobile App Updates Distribution List

Dear Mobile App Development and Product Teams,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you on behalf of the Knowledge Office Team at our organisation. We are responsible for the content on the knowledge management portal used across the organisation, as well as the content on the help and support section of the website which is used by our customers.

We understand that you are continuously working on updates and changes to our mobile application, ENBD X. As a team that is responsible for maintaining and updating the content on various platforms for our customers, we would like to be included in your distribution list for any changes or updates related to the mobile application.

This will enable us to stay informed about any changes made to the mobile application and update our knowledge management portal and help and support section accordingly. This will not only ensure that the information we provide is accurate but will also help our customers to get a better understanding of the changes made to the mobile application.

Therefore, we request you to kindly add our mailbox, knowledgeoffice@email.com, to your distribution list for any changes or updates related to the mobile application.

We appreciate your support and cooperation in this matter and look forward to a positive response from your end.

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
On behalf of Knowledge Office Team.
