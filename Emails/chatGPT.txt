Subject: Request for Meeting Confirmation: Customer Care Section of the Website

Dear Abhinaya,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your confirmation on when we can schedule a meeting with yourself, Gautam, and the Knowledge Office team. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the content governance of the customer care section of the website, day-in, day-out (operational) updates on the customer care section of the website, and the clean-up and critical maintenance activity of the content in the customer care section of the website.

As you are aware, we initially reached out to Ashish and his team to assist us in fixing the critical errors observed as part of our maintenance activity. However, we were redirected to you and Gautam as the owners of the Customer Care section of the website.

We would appreciate it if you could let us know your availability for the meeting, including Gautam's availability, and the preferred mode of communication (In-Person or Virtual) at your earliest convenience. Please let us know if there are any specific time slots that work best for you, and we will do our best to accommodate them.

We look forward to discussing the content governance of the customer care section of the website and the clean-up and critical maintenance activity with you and your team. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your time and attention.
